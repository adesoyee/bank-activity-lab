# README
The purpose of this project is to engineer a pipeline in Python to analyze stock data. The pipeline will be used by the machine learning team to restructure terabytes of data, which will subsequently be integrated with daily news headline data to measure how reliably sentiment predicts stock price. I am to complete the data engineering project my classmate started.

Project Description:

As a data engineer at Banking Objects of Portugal (BOofP), a leading national consumer bank, I have been tasked with the development of a data analysis pipeline in Python. This pipeline will play a critical role in the bank's efforts to harness the power of data and enhance decision-making processes, particularly in the realm of stock market analysis. The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the machine learning team's work in restructuring terabytes of historical stock market data. This restructured data will then be integrated with daily news headlines, allowing BOofP to measure the reliability of sentiment analysis in predicting stock prices. The use of data Restructuring was used. The machine learning team relies on the pipeline to efficiently restructure and preprocess the raw data. This includes cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to make the data suitable for predictive modeling. A challenge when working on this was contionously getting error codes due to not saving before running the validation code.
